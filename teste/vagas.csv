The DealRoom Story:
The idea for DealRoom began in a small office in downtown Chicago in 2012. Our founder, Kison, was running a boutique M&A practice that focused on hospitality.

He knew there had to be a better way and that the industry desperately needed a product purpose-built for M&A optimization. Kison’s goal was to disrupt the M&A process, for good.

Empowered by People: Like the artists we serve and the music they make, our differences make us stronger. This is a place where every talent can belong and build a career.

We remain committed to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We know it fosters a culture where you can truly belong, contribute, and grow.

HIGHLIGHTS

If you've been a sales leader at early-stage SaaS startups, this is a great opportunity to move into a Head of Sales role where you will lead all prospecting and closing efforts and report to the CEO.
It's a great time to join as you’re early enough to have a significant impact, but not so early that we don’t already have a strong product and repeatable sales process (hundreds of paying customers, #1 on G2, etc).
This is a front-line leadership role. You will get to build an in-person sales culture at our SF office and get in the weeds by coaching reps, co-selling larger deals, and doing what it takes to win.


About Perfect Venue

Private events and catering can significantly increase restaurant revenue, but many restaurants are stuck using outdated, error-prone manual processes - unlike the sophisticated software employed by large chains. Perfect Venue is leveling the playing field by offering local restaurants an affordable, user-friendly, event management tool to help local restaurants compete with big chains. This is just the start, with plans to expand into a broader marketplace that includes venues and other event services (DJs, florists, etc).

Recently featured in TechCrunch, Fortune, Axios, Eater, and others.

OUR CULTURE & VALUES

We love helping people. Above all, we see our job as solving our customers' problems. Small business owners work tirelessly to serve their customers, and we work just as hard to serve them.

We’re customer obsessed
We build exceptional products
We FITFO
We play to win
We think like scientists

We're obviously biased - but this is a phenomenal opportunity for an ambitious sales leader. You’ll be early enough to have a significant impact, but not so early that we don’t already have strong PMF and a repeatable sales process (hundreds of paying customers, #1 G2, etc).

We have customers nationwide paying hundreds of dollars per month and are backed by leading Silicon Valley investors, including the 1st investor in Zoom. We have a very high close rate as our product is the #1 rated venue management tool on G2.com. Since our product is essentially a CRM for restaurants, it will feel familiar to you which makes it easy to learn and sell with conviction.
